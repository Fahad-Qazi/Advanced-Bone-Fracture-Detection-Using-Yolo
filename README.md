## 🚀 Project Showcase: Advanced Bone Fracture Detection Using Deep Learning (YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10)
📍 University of Peshawar

### 🔬 Overview:
I’ve successfully developed a real-time AI-powered bone fracture detection system using cutting-edge YOLO models (YOLOv8, v9t, v10). This system was trained on 31,787 X-ray images and achieved a mAP@0.5 of 0.942 with perfect precision at high confidence thresholds. It features a Streamlit-based UI for clinical usability—enabling healthcare professionals to make faster and more accurate diagnoses with minimal effort.

### Project Objective
To develop a high-performance, AI-powered diagnostic tool that automatically detects bone fractures in X-ray images using advanced deep learning models. The system offers a fast, scalable, and clinically usable interface for doctors and radiologists.

### 🧠 Why this matters:
- Manual diagnosis can be slow and error-prone, especially in busy or underserved hospitals. My solution:
- Detects fractures in real-time with high accuracy
- Reduces diagnostic delays and radiologist workload
- Integrates easily into clinical settings
- Supports deployment on edge devices for remote clinics

### 🛠️ Key Technologies & Tools
- Models: YOLOv8 (Nano & Small), YOLOv9t, YOLOv10 (Nano & Small)
- Frameworks & Tools: PyTorch, Ultralytics, Streamlit, OpenCV, Roboflow
- Loss Function: Focal Loss with class imbalance handling
- Data Size: 31,787 labeled X-ray images (fracture, normal, background)
- Augmentation: Flip, rotate, elastic transform, brightness/contrast tuning

### 📈 Core Achievements:
- Trained & evaluated 5 YOLO variants
- Achieved F1-score of 0.92 with YOLOv8s
- Developed intuitive front-end using Streamlit
- Performed deep comparative model analysis
- Conducted data augmentation & quality control to boost generalization

### 💻 System Features
- Streamlit Web App: Upload X-ray images, adjust detection confidence, and visualize results in real-time.
- Custom Training Pipeline: Fine-tuned models with early stopping, OneCycleLR scheduling, and Focal Loss for class imbalance.
- Model Evaluation: Confusion matrix, PR curves, and mAP analysis done for all models.

### 🔍 Impact & Innovation
- Provides a cost-effective clinical support system to assist radiologists.
- Designed for deployment on low-resource devices (edge AI).
- Capable of handling real-time image input with high responsiveness.
- Trained and validated on diverse anatomical regions, unlike prior works focused only on specific bones.

### 🌟 What I Learned
- Deep understanding of object detection pipelines and model evaluation metrics.
- Practical skills in data labeling, model fine-tuning, hyperparameter optimization, and UI deployment.
- Importance of balancing performance across classes (normal vs fracture) in medical diagnostics.
